`astsa` is the R package to accompany the [Springer](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319524511) text, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/)  and the Chapman & Hall text  [Time Series A Data Analysis Approach using R](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsda/)... both by Shumway and Stoffer. 

The Springer text was written under version 1.8 and the Chapman & Hall text was written under version 1.8.8. Version 1.9 will work for both texts with only some minor changes that won't affect any of the data analysis. 


I won't always push the latest version of the package to CRAN because sometimes it's a pain working with those people.  Consequently, the latest working version of the package will always be here. 
 
* Working on v1.10 for CRAN 
* Version 1.9.4 on GitHub
* Version 1.9 on CRAN 
* See the [News](https://github.com/nickpoison/astsa/blob/master/NEWS.md) for further details about the state of the package and the changelog.
